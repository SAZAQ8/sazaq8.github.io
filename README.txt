Files included:

How to preview locally:
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open any .html file (e.g., index.html) in your browser.

How to publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a GitHub repository named username.github.io (replace username with your GitHub username).
2. Upload all files to the repository (you can drag & drop on GitHub web UI).
3. Visit https://username.github.io to see the site. Alternatively, enable GitHub Pages in repository settings from main branch.

Important: WhatsApp number
- Current placeholder in js/app.js: WA_NUMBER = "+965XXXXXXXX"
- Replace +965XXXXXXXX with your real WhatsApp number in international format (for example +96550123456).
- After replacement, re-upload js/app.js or edit via GitHub UI so the 'Order via WhatsApp' links work.

Customization:
- To change products, edit the PRODUCTS array in js/app.js (name fields in 'en' and 'ar', price, and img).
- To change theme colors, edit css/style.css variables.
